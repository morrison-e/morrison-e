# Hi there

## My Background

My name is Isabella and my pronouns are she/they. I recently started a program in full-stack web development. Before this, I completed 2 years in nursing school, but left due to poor health.

## My Experience with Tech

My experience with tech is fairly limited, beyond Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. I also taught myself a little bit of JavaScript over the spring, although I'm not sure how much I've retained since then.

In my program, I am currently learning HTML, in addition to introductory web development and design for web developers. I am enjoying my classes so far, despite spending all of my time studying.

As I continue my education, I look forward to creating a diverse portfolio and will work on side projects in my spare time.
